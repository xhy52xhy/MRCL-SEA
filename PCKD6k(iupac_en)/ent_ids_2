29060	Study has been undertaken to determine the stability of four benzodiazepines: clonazepam, midazolam, flunitrazepam & oxazepam in whole blood samples. Spiked blood was stored at four different temperatures (room temperature, 4 degrees C, -20 degrees C & -80 degrees C) & analysed at selected times during 1 yr. Determination was performed on the first, third & seventh day during the first wk, then once/wk for 3 wk, once every 2 wk for 4 wk, then once/month for 4 months & finally, once every 2 months. Extraction was performed using liquid-liquid extraction with 1-chlorobutane, while quantification was carried out using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a photodiode-array ultraviolet detector. At room temperature, the concn of all benzodiazepines decreased over 1 yr to 100 & 70% for low & high concns, respectively. At 4 deg C, the decr was between 90 & 100% for low concns & between 50 & 80% for high concns. At -20 deg C, the measured decr was between 10 & 20% for high & low concns, respectively. At -80 deg C, the measured loss was not significant at high concn except for midazolam. However, at low concn the determined decr was between 5 & 12%. The data collected suggests that quantitative results concerning long-term stored samples should be interpreted with caution in forensic cases. Further investigations concerning the stability of drugs in whole blood or other biological samples, additional methods of identification & determination as well as the establishment of optimal storage conditions should be undertaken in forensic cases.

29068	... The 'experimental shelf lives' of ergometrine and methylergometrine tablets were examined by exposing the tablets to seven artificially controlled conditions. Samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography at nine different sampling times over a period of 1 year to determine the content of ergometrine and methylergometrine. Under refrigeration (test I), less than 90% of the stated amount of active ingredient was found in the tablets after 14 weeks in the case of ergometrine and 21 weeks in the case of methylergometrine. When stored in the dark at 40 degrees C and 75% relative humidity (test VI), the tablets fall outside accepted specification (= 90-110% of state amount of active ingredient) within 3 weeks in the case of ergometrine and 21 weeks in the case of coated methylergometrine tablets. The stability of uncoated ergometrine tablets was far less than that of coated methylergometrine tablets. Instability worsened under extreme humid conditions (test IV and VI), and hot conditions (test V), for both ergometrine and methylergometrine. From week 31 onwards the coating did not seem to protect the compound anymore, irrespective of the condition of exposure. Tropical conditions make the tablets unstable with humidity as the main adverse factor. The sugar-coated methylergometrine tablets are more stable under humid/hot conditions than the non-coated ergometrine tablets. Under all simulated conditions both oral ergometrine and methylergometrine tablets are unstable.

31102	The stability of epirubicin in sodium chloride 0.9% injection, the degradation kinetics of an epirubicin 1 mg/ml solution and the stability of epirubicin 2 mg/ml in polypropylene syringes stored under hospital conditions were studied at various temperature. The degradation of epirubicin in sodium chloride 0.9% solutions followed first order kinetics. The shelf life was defined as the time by which the epirubicin concentration had decreased by 10% from the initial concentration. Epirubicin was stable in sodium chloride 0.9% injection stored in polypropylene containers for all time periods and all conditions. That resulted in a shelf life of at least 14 and 180 days at 25 deg C and 4 deg C, respectively. The maximum decrease in epirubicin concentration observed at 25 deg C and 14 days was 4%, and at 4 deg C and 180 days was 8%.

The surface of sample pellets of all crystalline forms turned gradually from white to yellow-orange upon exposure to light, and the discoloration rate of form II was faster than that of forms I and III, indicating that form II was the most unstable of the three. The semilogarithmic plots of the photodegradation profiles of the various polymorphs were straight lines, including the induction period, indicating that degradation of the drug on the surface followed first-order kinetics.

31295	Photodecomposition of aspartame in aqueous solutions under different conditions of light intensity and pH were studied. The effects of photosensitizers (riboflavin and methylene blue) and ascorbic acid on aspartame stability in aqueous solutions at different pH under light were also studied. Light illumination significantly increased aspartame degradation in an aqueous solution (pH 7), indicating that aspartame was very unstable under the illuminated conditions. In the dark, 91% of aspartame in an aqueous solution at pH 7 remained after 10 h of storage. Under 5500 lux of light, however, 39% of aspartame in the solution was destroyed after 10 h of storage. Aspartame degradation under light followed simple zero-order reaction kinetics. The higher the light intensity, the greater the degradation of aspartame. The relative reaction rate for the destruction of aspartame under 0, 1100, 3300 and 5500 lux was 1:1.42:2.80:4.61. The photodecomposition rate of aspartame varied with the pH of the system. Aspartame degradation was fastest at pH 7.0, followed by pH 4.0 and pH 6.0, in decreasing order. Addition of 4.8 ppm riboflavin or 4.8 ppm methylene blue significantly accelerated the aspartame decomposition at pH 7 in the presence of light. There were, however, no significant photosensitizing effects of these sensitizers on aspartame destruction at pH 6 and pH 4. Addition of 1.2x10-4 increased the aspartame degradation at pH 7.0, but did not affect the destruction rate of aspartame at pH 6.0 and pH 4.0.
